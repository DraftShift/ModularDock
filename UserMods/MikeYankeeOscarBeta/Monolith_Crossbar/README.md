# ShortFrame

### Not compatible with Door Buffer

Modified left and right part of the frame so less Z space is used. Total Z height is reduced from 169.9mm* to 155.9mm*. Everything else stays the same. **But you need to use Tophat**

### Using SB is supported only with special docking path which is bellow
```
params_shortframe_path: [{'y':10.50 ,'z':6}, {'y':8.50, 'z':2}, {'y':5.5, 'z':0}, {'z':0, 'y':0, 'f':0.5}, {'z':-10, 'y':4}, {'z':-10, 'y':20}]
```

( \* measured between top extrusion and the crossbar )

## Support for these are not handled by the StealthChanger Team, it is handled by BlackShade on discord
##  All docks must use the same height, DO NOT MIX AND MATCH
