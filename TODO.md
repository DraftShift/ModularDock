# TODO

- [x] Make short DB version (can only user short DBs for all tools if used)
- [x] Make BOM
- [x] Upload CAD

- [x] Make sure all holes follow [3dp standards](https://github.com/gregsaun/maker_cheatsheet/blob/master/3d_printing/techniques.md)
- [x] Add shorter frame with no container for Micron and smaller options
- [x] Convert Container to be 1515 compat so it works with 2020 and 1515 frames
- [x] Make the top and bottom of the frame into replacable pieces (this is where the 2020 to 1515 will happen)
- [x] Remove the 2020 thickness of the frame and only use the 1515 to reduce parts, the frame ends will sort the options
- [x] Add 5mm to the DB to DB links, the space will help clear wider extruders and looks better
- [x] Make 1515 tops and bottoms and links
- [x] Fix Tabs on Containers
- [x] Bore rail holes in 2mm to use 10mm M5s instead of 12mm
